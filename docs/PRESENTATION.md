# Building a Production-Grade Passwordless Authentication System

## Introduction

### 1.1 What this demo is

- **Purpose**: A live **passwordless user accounts** demo—**passkeys (WebAuthn)** for primary login, **email OTP** as backup, with flows designed to avoid obvious account enumeration where implemented.
- **Stack (implementation detail)**: React app with type-safe routes and server functions, Drizzle + SQLite, JWT-backed verification for OTP links, SimpleWebAuthn for passkeys.

> **Speaker Note:** "This isn't a slideware-only story—you can try the real app. The headline is passwordless auth: passkeys plus email codes as a fallback. Under the hood I'm using a modern full-stack React setup so the client and server parts of WebAuthn and OTP stay in sync and type-checked."

### 1.2 Passwords are a security nightmare

- **Problem**: Users reuse passwords across multiple sites.
- **Consequence**: A breach in one service compromises user accounts everywhere.
- **Complexity**: Enforcing complex passwords leads to users writing them down or forgetting them.
- **Solution**: Remove the password entirely.

> **Speaker Note:** Start with a hook. "How many of you actually enjoy implementing 'Forgot Password' flows? Nobody? Exactly."

### 1.3 Authenticator apps are a hack

- **Friction**: Requires a second device (usually a phone).
- **UX**: Copy-pasting 6-digit codes is tedious.
- **Phishing**: While better than SMS, they are still susceptible to real-time phishing.
- **Recovery**: Losing the device often means getting locked out.

### 1.4 The Ideal User Flow

1. **Primary Auth (Fast)**: Passkey discovery mode - User's device automatically discovers their account via biometrics (FaceID/TouchID). No email input required.
2. **Fallback Auth (Reliable)**: If passkey unavailable -> User requests OTP code via email.
3. **Email Flow**: Always succeeds - sends 8-character alphanumeric code if account exists, or notification email if account doesn't exist.

- **Benefits**: No secrets to remember. Phishing resistant. Seamless experience. **No account enumeration** - attackers can't discover which emails are registered.

> **Speaker Note:** "Before we get to the fancy bio-metrics, we need a bedrock. Email is that bedrock. An OTP code is just a password that changes every time and is delivered to a device you already unlocked (your phone/laptop). But notice: with passkeys in discovery mode, users don't even need to type their email - the passkey itself identifies the account. This is both simpler and more secure."

## Logging in with email (OTP Codes)

### 2.1 Simple but secure

- **Concept**: Send a unique, time-limited, 8-character alphanumeric code to the user's email.
- **Security**: Access to the email account proves identity. The code must be entered in the same browser session.
- **UX**: Enter code -> Logged in. Works across devices (can read code on phone, enter on desktop).

_(Diagram Idea: Sequence diagram showing User -> Server -> Email -> User enters code -> Server)_

### 2.2 Implementing OTP codes

- **Code Generation**: Generate 8-character alphanumeric codes (A-Z, 0-9) for significantly improved security over numeric codes.
- **Code Storage**: Codes are hashed (SHA-256) and stored in the `userAuthAttempts` database table, not in the JWT.
- **Token Generation**: We sign a JWT containing `userAuthAttemptId` (not the code hash) along with `userId` or `email`.
- **Security**: Even if the JWT is decoded, the code cannot be revealed since it's stored separately in the database.

### 2.2.1 Why 8-Character Alphanumeric Codes?

**The Security Requirement:**
Unlike traditional 2FA authenticator apps (which provide a secondary authentication factor), OTP codes in this passwordless system are the **primary and only authentication method**. This fundamental difference requires substantially higher security.

**The Math:**

- **6-digit numeric codes**: 10^6 = **1,000,000** possible combinations
- **8-character alphanumeric codes**: 36^8 = **2,821,109,907,456** possible combinations (2.8 trillion)

**Why This Matters:**
The 8-character alphanumeric format provides approximately **2.8 million times** more entropy than 6-digit numeric codes. This massive keyspace ensures that:

1. **Brute-force attacks are computationally infeasible** - Even with unlimited attempts, an attacker would need to try trillions of combinations
2. **Rate limiting becomes less critical** - The large keyspace already provides strong defense against brute-force guessing in this demo
3. **Primary authentication security** - Since there's no password as a first factor, the OTP code must be strong enough to stand alone

> **Speaker Note:** "You might wonder why we don't just use 6-digit codes like authenticator apps. The key difference is that authenticator codes are a _second_ factor - you still need a password first. Our OTP codes are the _only_ factor. That means they need to be strong enough to resist brute-force attacks on their own. 8 alphanumeric characters gives us 2.8 trillion possible combinations versus just 1 million for 6 digits. That's the difference between 'hard to guess' and 'computationally impossible to guess'."

```typescript:src/server/auth.ts
function generateOTPCode(): string {
	const chars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";
	let code = "";
	for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
		code += chars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length));
	}
	return code;
}

// Code is hashed and stored in userAuthAttempts table
const codeHash = hashOTPCode(code);
await db.insert(userAuthAttempts).values({
	email: user.email,
	userId: user.id,
	codeHash,
	purpose: "login",
	expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 15 * 60 * 1000),
	used: false,
});

// JWT only contains reference to the attempt, not the code
const token = await signCodeVerificationToken(user.id, user.email, attempt.id);
```

> **Speaker Note:** "We use JWTs here not for sessions, but as a one-time-use entry ticket. The code itself is stored securely in the database, hashed with SHA-256. The JWT only contains a reference to the attempt, ensuring that even if the token is decoded, the code remains secret."

- **Route guard**:
  We use `beforeLoad` to verify the token _before_ the component renders. This ensures we don't flash authorized UI to unauthorized users.

```typescript:src/routes/login-via-code.$codeVerificationToken.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/login-via-code/$codeVerificationToken')({
	beforeLoad: async ({ params }) => {
		// 1. Verify token format (but don't authenticate yet)
		await verifyCodeVerificationToken(params.codeVerificationToken);
		return { tokenValid: true };
	},
	component: LoginViaCodePage
});
```

> **Speaker Note:** "Notice `beforeLoad`. In this stack, we verify the token _before_ the React component even renders. The actual code verification happens when the user submits the form, ensuring the code is validated server-side."

### 2.3 Signup Flow

- **Signup Process**: Uses the same OTP-based flow as login.
- **Database Schema**: Emails must be unique.
- **Resilience**: OTP codes act as the "Account Recovery" method if a user loses their Passkey.

## Passkeys (WebAuthn)

### 3.1 Why Passkeys?

- **Standard**: Built on FIDO2/WebAuthn.
- **Phishing Resistance**: The browser enforces origin binding. You cannot be phished by `evil-google.com` because the browser won't release the credential for `google.com`.
- **UX**: Biometric verification (FaceID, TouchID) is faster than typing.

> **Speaker Note:** "OTP codes are great, but they still have some friction. You have to leave the app, open email, read the code, and type it back in. Passkeys solve the _friction_. Think of a Passkey like a hardware 2FA key (YubiKey), but virtualized into your phone's secure enclave (FaceID/TouchID)."

### 3.2 The Flow (Challenge-Response)

_(Diagram Idea: Show the Server sending a random "Challenge", and the Browser signing it with the Private Key stored in the Secure Enclave)_

1. **Registration**: Device generates Key Pair. Public Key sent to Server. Private Key stays on device.
2. **Authentication**: Server sends Challenge. Device signs Challenge with Private Key. Server verifies with Public Key.

### 3.3 Implementation (SimpleWebAuthn)

We use `@simplewebauthn/server` to handle the complex cryptographic verification.

- **Database Schema**: We store the Public Key and a Counter (to prevent cloning).

```typescript:src/db/schema.ts
export const passkeys = sqliteTable('passkeys', {
	// ...
	publicKey: text('public_key').notNull(), // The only part we store
	counter: integer('counter').notNull().default(0), // Prevents replay attacks
	transports: text('transports'),
});
```

> **Speaker Note:** "This `counter` field is important. If a passkey is cloned (which shouldn't happen), the counter helps us detect replay attacks. Also note we _only_ store the Public Key. The Private Key never leaves the user's device."

- **Registration Logic**:

```typescript:src/lib/passkey.ts
// 1. Server generates options
export async function generateRegistrationOptions(...) {
	const opts = {
        // ...
		authenticatorSelection: {
			residentKey: 'required', // Enables "One-click" login
			userVerification: 'required', // Forces FaceID/PIN
			authenticatorAttachment: 'platform',
		},
	};
    // ...
}

// 2. Server verifies response
export async function verifyRegistrationResponse(...) {
	const verification = await swaVerifyRegistrationResponse({
		response,
		expectedChallenge,
		expectedOrigin: ORIGIN,
		expectedRPID: RP_ID,
        // ...
	});

    if (verification.verified) {
        // Save public key to DB
    }
}
```

> **Speaker Note:** "WebAuthn is a beast of a protocol. Don't write it from scratch. We use `SimpleWebAuthn` which handles the binary parsing and crypto checks."

## Security considerations

### 4.1 Rate limiting (Critical)

- **Attack Vector**: Attackers can trigger thousands of emails to random addresses (Email Bombing) or brute-force tokens.
- **Defense**:
  - Limit "Send Email" requests by IP address (e.g., 5 per hour).
  - Limit requests by target Email (prevent spamming one victim).
  - Exponential backoff for failed login attempts.

> **Speaker Note:** "If you take one thing away from this talk: **Rate Limit your email endpoints.** If you don't, you are building a free weapon for spammers."

### 4.2 Account Enumeration Prevention

**Why prevent account enumeration?**

- **Privacy**: Attackers can't discover which emails are registered users.
- **Targeting**: Prevents attackers from building lists of valid accounts for targeted attacks.
- **Reconnaissance**: Stops attackers from mapping your user base before launching attacks.

**How we prevent it:**

1. **Passkeys (Discovery Mode)**:
   - Users never enter their email - the passkey itself discovers the account.
   - No email input = no opportunity for enumeration.
   - The browser's WebAuthn API handles account discovery securely.

2. **Email Login (Always Succeeds)**:
   - The request always returns success, regardless of whether the account exists.
   - If account exists → Send 8-character OTP code email.
   - If account doesn't exist → Send notification email explaining someone tried to login and that email isn't registered.
   - **Why it's safe to say "account doesn't exist"**: The email goes to the owner of that email address. They already know whether they have an account, so revealing this information doesn't help attackers.

> **Speaker Note:** "This is both simpler and more secure. Passkeys eliminate the enumeration attack vector entirely, and our email flow always succeeds - we just send different emails. The key insight is that when an account doesn't exist, we're telling the email owner something they already know, so there's no security risk."

### 4.3 Signups

- **Verification First**: Never create a `User` record until email ownership is proven.
- **Flow**:
  1. User enters name and email -> Generate 8-character OTP code.
  2. Store code hash in `userAuthAttempts` table with purpose "signup".
  3. Send OTP code email.
  4. User enters code -> Verify code from database -> _Then_ create user in DB.
